The chatbot settings can be found in the [General_Settings.md](https://github.com/Themightyfirefly/TUna/blob/main/General_Settings.md) file. These settings have to be copied line by line, as there is no automatic upload in the online GPT editor.

The prompt, discussed in detail in the System Prompt section, can be found in the [system_prompt](https://github.com/Themightyfirefly/TUna/tree/main/system_prompt) directory. The prompt must be copied into the online editor, just like the general settings.
