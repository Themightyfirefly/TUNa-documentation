Additionally to the knowledge, the [final TUNa release](https://github.com/Themightyfirefly/TUna/releases/tag/v1.0.0_final_stable) on GitHub also includes the project sources. These sources can be used by future project groups to further work on the chatbot or to create new chatbots.

Should future project groups decide to build upon the existing project and plan to use GitHub, they can also [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the TUNa repository, which will enable the direct execution of the TUNa workflow without the need for additional setup steps.

The information regarding chatbot development included in this documentation has also been made available through the TUNa website at [https://themightyfirefly.github.io/TUNa-documentation/](https://themightyfirefly.github.io/TUNa-documentation/.). As the website is directly linked in the main README file inside the TUNa GitHub repository, it allows future project groups to quickly access information regarding the developement of the chatbot. We want to provide the knowledge we have gained throughout the development of TUNa, so that future project groups can build upon our chatbot and the methods we have utilised.
